# About
This repository contains the frontend of a website I'm currently working on. It was made in JavaScript using React and is fully responsive. Backend coming soon...

# 📚Bookland
Bookland is a fictional bookstore that offers all different kinds of books, as well as meet & greet's with your favourite authors, book signings, group readings and much more.
The website provides:

- an insight to all of the latest discounts and events through an automatic news slider on the home page
- an online shop
- customer ratings review
- contact information with the option of contacting the company directly through a simple contact form
- the option of creating an account which allows users to add available items to wishlist as well as leave their ratings on the company
